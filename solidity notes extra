so just like how in golang we have interfaces coming in to prevent two different but related structs from repeating the same methods within them .. In solidity we have something similar. 

In other words we are grouping structs which are like classes into one class by virtue of their methods. because they have similar methods the interface they form is like a class that can give 
uses to those structs.. 

In solidity when we create interfaces what we can use it for is two main things 
  - Contract to contract interactions 
  - Implement the interface in the smart contract.. if you dont implement all of its methods it becomes an abstract contract. Abstract Contracts are mostly based contract /parent contracts 
that children / derived contracts would inherit from 


External functions do not have a function selector, as they are called via the calldata mechanism. This means they cannot be overridden by functions with the same name in derived contracts.
unless we use the virtual / override trick 

 External functions do not have a function selector included in the function call. Instead, the function signature (name and parameter types) is encoded separately and passed in the calldata.
Access: Public and internal functions can access contract state variables directly, while external functions cannot
